    <h4>Monday</h4>
    <h5>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h5>

    <h4>Tuesday</h4>
    <h5>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h5>
    <p>Unfortunately I wasn't able to accomplish any of my goals, because I agreed to help out 3 classmates by participating in their interviews. After doing 3 in a row, I felt too fatigued to do any of my own work.</p>

    <h5>What will I do today?</h5>
    <p>My cold has gotten much worse so I will rest but still make sure to recieve feedback on my insight and problem statement. If I feel better later in the day, I'll try to catch up on yesterdays tasks.</p>

    <h5>Are there any blockers?</h5>
    <p>Having a bad cold.</p>

    <h4>Wednesday</h4>
    <h5>What did I accomplish yesterday?</h5>
    <p>I slept throughout the day, trying to get over my cold. By the evening I felt a lot better so I was able to catch up on my tasks from Monday. I completed my empathy map, created 2 personas, and wrote a current state user journey. Then brainstormed solutions, highlighting my top 2.</p>

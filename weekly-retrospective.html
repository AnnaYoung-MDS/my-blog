    <h3>Week 01</h3>
    <h5>What went well</h5>
    <p>This week I accomplished all my goals. I picked my topic, finished research and conducted 5 interviews, with another interview happening this evening. Additionally, I wrote a draft of my problem statement and insight. By planning out my week I felt it took a lot of stress of me by being able to see what I needed to do and when.</p>

    <h5>What didn’t go well</h5>
    <p>I heavily struggled narrowing down my problem statement as there's two paths I want to take with this. Writing an insight too was a challenge, but these are things I usually struggle with and need to practice and learn more about.</p>

    <h5>What can be improved</h5>
    <p>My problem statement and insight could be improved or narrowed down a bit more.</p>

    <h5>What actions will I take for the next sprint.</h5>
    <p>Next week, I'll ask for feedback on my probelm statement and insight, then refine them.</p>

    <h3>Week 02</h3>
    <h5>What went well</h5>
    <p>Despite having strep throat, I was still able to complete all my tasks, prior to the WIP presentation. I felt proud I was able to get everything done this week. By resting during the days and taking cold medications, I'd be able to work in the evenings.</p>

    <h5>What didn’t go well</h5>
    <p>Having strep throat did made me feel a bit under pressure, especially on Tuesday when I wasn't able to do any of my Monday tasks. I also had to get a last minute extension for my WIP, as I thought I'd be well enough to present by then, however I was not.</p>

    <h5>What can be improved</h5>
    <p>Not leaving an extension last minute. If I'm still sick the day before I present I'll apply for an extension as a precaution.</p>

    <h5>What actions will I take for the next sprint.</h5>
    <p>On Monday I'm going to present my WIP, and recieve feedback on my progress from this week. Then I'll begin prototyping.</p>

    <h3>Week 03</h3>
    <h5>What went well</h5>
    <p>Managing to do a lot of work in a short amount of time while struggling with health issues.</p>

    <h5>What didn’t go well</h5>
    <p>Nothing felt it went very well this week. As the feedback I got meant I had to re do almost a week's worth of work in one night, while not fully recorved from strep throat. Then out of the blue some health issues popped up. Because I was in a lot pain I could only do a minimal amount of work, then when I started the medication I had to then deal with fatigue, still unable to do the amount of work I needed done.</p>

    <h5>What can be improved</h5>
    <p>I need to stop overworking myself during and after being sick so I can recover faster.</p>

    <h5>What actions will I take for the next sprint.</h5>
    <p>I will continue to catch up on this weeks work and finalise my visual direction, then start my proof of concept, design strategy, and pitch.</p>

    <h3>Week 01</h3>
    <h5>What went well</h5>
    <p>This week I accomplished all my goals. I picked my topic, finished research and conducted 5 interviews, with another interview happening this evening. Additionally, I wrote a draft of my problem statement and insight. By planning out my week I felt it took a lot of stress of me by being able to see what I needed to do and when.</p>

    <h5>What didn’t go well</h5>
    <p>I heavily struggled narrowing down my problem statement as there's two paths I want to take with this. Writing an insight too was a challenge, but these are things I usually struggle with and need to practice and learn more about.</p>

    <h5>What can be improved</h5>
    <p>My problem statement and insight could be improved or narrowed down a bit more.</p>

    <h5>What actions will I take for the next sprint.</h5>
    <p>Next week, I'll ask for feedback on my probelm statement and insight, then refine them.</p>
